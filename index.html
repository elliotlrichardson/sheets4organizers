                    <p class="lead mb-4">Hey everyone! My name is Elliot, it’s a pleasure to meet you :^) </p>
                    <p>I work in progressive data and have a frickin’ blast noodling around in Google Sheets. There are a lot of tips and tricks that have been helpful to me as a data director for a youth organizing team (hi NextGen Maine) and as a data manager at the Sunrise Movement. But I know not every team has a data director; my coworkers and I on the MA for Warren team did not have a data director or any data staff and we did our best until the best full-time volunteer of all-time joined the squad (s/o to Tanay, you are truly the best). That experience as an organizer helped me understand what is useful to know and my experiences in data have taught me how to build tools to deliver that information to the absolute heroes doing the actual organizing. But if you don’t have someone delivering that information to you, I’m hoping I can help you deliver it to yourselves and keep doing the amazing organizing that you are doing! </p>

                    <p>So with that goal in mind, I have done my best to create and compile explanations and tutorials in a coherent way for y’all. Right off the bat, I’d like to say that <strong>I do not have teaching experience </strong>and am <i><strong>very</i></strong> open to feedback. (!!!!!!!) I hope that the following information is helpful to you and I’d love to chat with you about it or answer questions as best as I can. My email is <a href="mailto:elliotlrichardson@gmail.com" target="_blank">elliotlrichardson@gmail.com</a> and I will be twiddling my thumbs just <strong>waiting</strong> for you to use me as a resource in the pursuit of collective liberation on a thriving planet.</p>

                                <li>I do not know how to explain these concepts through text so I have made video tutorials demonstrating them (sorry)</li>
                                <li>I am not good at pivot tables! Idk what they are! (ugh I’ll probably add them eventually)</li>
                                <li>I will link a copy of the sheet I’m using in the tutorials at the top of each section</li>
                                <li>In the list of covered topics, I will identify functions using an equal sign (i.e. =average)</li>
                                <li>Feel free to skip around as needed (command-F the page if you have a specific question!)</li>
                                <li>None of the personal information in these spreadsheets is real! I am using random name and number generators to simulate datasets similar to the ones I’ve worked with IRL</li>
                                <li>I’m going to make a lot of references to Olivia Rodrigo, get over it!!</li>
                                <li>I am not getting paid to make this so if you wanted to buy me an Earl Grey, my venmo, paypal, and cashapp links are at the top of the page!</li>

                    <p>Foremost among my interests is our progress as a civilization towards a world in which everyone can live a comfortable and healthy life in harmony with a planet that has thriving wildlife. This vision incorporates so many things: climate justice, indigenous sovereignty, racial equity, queer liberation, disability justice, universal healthcare, prison abolition, universal jobs guarantee, protected democratic systems, universal childcare, and more. I love approaching the steps to get there as puzzles and problem solving with people as passionate as I am.  Let's collaborate to get to that future :^)  </p>
                    <p>Though I am prone to thinking that everything is political, I do have some hobbies and interests that aren't explicitly political. I love music (as most do) and like to consider myself an amateur singer-songwriter. I'm a bit rusty on the piano and still acquainting myself with the layout of the neck of a guitar, but I have a lot of fun playing and singing with friends. Not surprisingly, I love karaoke (live-band is very cool if you can find it). My absolute favorite musical artist is Frank Ocean, a queer Black man making history in the R&B genre. Highly recommend checking out his album, Channel Orange, as an introduction to his work!</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Part of my love for the planet is a love for its wildlife! I'm not unique for my love of animals but I'd be remiss if I left it off this page. I'm especially awe-struck when it comes to large and intelligent sea mammals. However, my favorite animal in the world is my sweet fluffy golden retriever Clementine who adores the snow and her plush golden retriever friend (as big as she is), Dinkles. I really like biking everywhere and I've recently gotten back into rock-climbing after loving it as a kid. I'm also a very knowledgeable and devoted eater of ice cream, a big Northeastern hockey fan, and an erratic reader of nonfiction, history, fiction, and sci-fi. <a href="mailto:elliotlrichardson@gmail.com" target="_blank">Send me some suggestions!</a></p>
